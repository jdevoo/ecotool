# ECOsens Data Tool

Ecotool is a Python-based command-line tool to transform data downloaded from the Sensaris ECOsens Senspod. It takes a sensor LOG file as input and generates JSON, GPX or CSV data to stdout. Additional switches allow the selection of sampling segments and fine-tuning of the downsampling algorithm (based on Douglas-Peucker).
